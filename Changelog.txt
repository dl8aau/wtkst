3.1.4.4

- fix: calls worked were not hidden in user list
- QARTestLogSync: don't crash on stopping

3.1.4.3

- fix: don't crash in Macro dialog if no Win-Test support is enabled

3.1.4.2

- fix: sent messages line lost "history"
    Old messages sent should be available in a drop down list.
- fix: don't crash on certain log entries (where the call is not found in the user list)

3.1.4.1 (Debug from wt_network_sync)

- Add network based log sync (no need anymore to run Win-Test on same PC)
  support for Win-Test4 and QARTest
  Log source can be changed in Options
- fix: log scanning stopped after disconnect (you had to restart wtKST to make it work)
- rework log checking: we will not touch the qrv database itself for "worked" QSOs
  Log and QRV are handled separately now (only "mixed" in the UI, "worked" is "green")
- fix "writing CQ/ instead of /CQ causes an exception" - (3.1.3.1 change was not enough)

3.1.3.4 (from KSTcom_class)

- Add IARU R2/R3 chats
  4 and 5 seems swapped compared to web version.
  7-9 missing in documentation, but same as web version

3.1.3.3 (from KSTcom_class)

- make calls list smaller (same height as before)
- fix tooltip in User list: QRV info was not correctly parsed, so log entries not displayed
- disable default tooltip display
- Filter URLs in messages and support opening them through context menu
  Also filter the HTML tags we get from the server to make it more readable
- Implement "setname" (now available!) and remove hack

3.1.3.2 (from KSTcom_class)

- station status taken from the Airscout database is either "unknown" or "qrv" - never "not qrv", which can only be manually set
- bug: fix manual "overlay" qrv database: Copy/merge from station DB and modify the local DB if needed. Store only entries, that are not "unknown". "Worked" is treated as "qrv".

- bug: fix exception if trying to hide calls and nothing to hide yet
- bug: filtering the user list did not work (regression)
- bug: Macro defaults used "\cq" instead of "/cq"


3.1.3.1 (from KSTcom_class)

- fix "enumerate" problem in Check_QSOs()
- close Sked dialog if no Win-Test is active anymore (don't crash)
- switch the user list from ListView to DataGridView
- (internal) move all ON4KST communication related code
    to a separate class
- fix "writing CQ/ instead of /CQ causes an exception"
- Use ScoutBase database from Airscout for qrv db, remove qrv.xml
    We use the DB read-only. On top of it a local db is used (a bit like
    before). Main difference: primary key is now call + locator and KST
    locator is saved in this db.

- Sked dialog updates dynamically
- Fix typo in band list
- First implementation of macros (thanks TobbY!)
- Try to figure out sked frequency from messages and propose for sked window (thanks TobbY!)

3.1.1.22

- rework Airscout watchlist Now only the calls from the KST user list will be in the watchlist, if they are >300km and closer than the limit set in options for Airplane scatter and visible (e.g. not in the Win-Test log or only qrv on a band not shown)

3.1.1.20

- bug: Spaces at end of KST name trigger an endless loop trying to set the name. Filter white space and improve logging
- Highlight numbers that may be frequencies in ChatRevie
- bug: fix users that use calls with extensions (e.g. "F6DRO-QRL")
- ChatReview should contain Sender of message
- include wtKST version in log

3.1.1.19

- Chat review starts with latest message
- fix hard hang when the connection to the server could not be established (so very likely to be triggered by autoconnect on a shaky network)

3.1.1.18

- URL on4kst.org -> on4kst.info

3.1.1.17

- if we clicked on our own call (in mymsg and msg list) use recipient call instead of (useless) own
- fix null pointer exception in get mode for wtSked dialog
- try to preserve call sign better when passing to e.g. Airscout (e.g. /p is not stripped off anymore)
- fix KST username is passed to Sked dialog without filtering
- fix issue in KST_Process_new_message() probably linked to regional settings

3.1.1.16

- fix skeds with frequencies >10GHz Use ulong or uint and increase the limit to 300GHz for
- parse Win-Test Status with tryparse to avoid crash Could be a fixed for the problem see
- context menu for sked and review also in msg and mymsg listview
- fix "show beacons" Datatable had more entries than before that were not updated correctly

3.1.1.15:

- Skeds did not work in XP (different socket handling). Reworked
- fix crash when "opon" is used in Win-Test
- fix regression: connection was not tested anymore (so disconnection was not detected)
- Focus handling (regression due to Win-Test Sked dialog)
- add option to use a "local" Airscout for double click action and watchlist

3.1.1.14:

- show time for "red" planes in AS column
- calculate AS planes only for users currently visible

3.1.1.13
- Changing locator through options already worked in previous version, this version supports changing name, too: it uses the "old" telnet
interface for this (so it is an ugly hack - but I don't see any alternative)
- trying to improve compatibility to Mono. As far as I know it starts and is mostly usable (main problem is the Listview used that is not a
Windows form element, but a native element from the Windows Explorer that behaves differently on Mono)
- User list now has an additional entry in the pop-up menu: Sked in Win-Test. You can send a sked to a station in the Win-Test network. The user then can automatically configure the TRX to the frequency passed. Unfortunately the locator is not transferred that way (only shown in notes)
- Update interval for user list removed - useless


3.1.1.12

- QSOs in my message window use color per call
- qrv.xml update based on recent qrv.xdt (DL0GTH)
- qrv.xml moved to wtKST directory (not into the versioned subdirectory anymore)
- qrv.xml is set to "qrv" when in wt Log
- Calls,marked as "not qrv" (black) will be hidden like the "worked " (green) ones
- bug: AS field – mouse right press - very sensitive to mouse movement, window closes quickly, sometimes appears above the top of the monitor.
- Store positions of splitters

3.1.1.11

- support other commands than just "/cq"
- New: Release build now with Debugging information (so stack trace yields something meaningful)

3.1.1.10

- my messages: mouseover displays long lines (as for "normal" messages
- bug fix:  wt Log correctly synchronized again - fix regression
- bug fix: "M1CRO/P-23" caused exception in user list
- bug fix: Regression in 3.1.1.6 - User list moves on updates - "useless" code is needed nevertheless, now it doesn't move on its own
- set own Locator from settings - name is not so easy... (so currently grayed out)

3.1.1.9

- bug fix: text entry field blinks if in disconnected state
- Win-Test Support for everyone

3.1.1.8

- implement simple "About" dialog

3.1.1.7

- bug fix: my messages list is sorted wrong (oldest messages at top)
- bug fix:  </> swapped for too far/too close
- store window position only if window is not minimized

3.1.1.6

- first test of Windows installer
- bug fix: OK2K or YU7A would match OK2OE or YU7ACO (regression)
- bug fix: changes in the Options dialog must not change properties (settings) directly, but only after OK is clicked
- Less flicker on Userlist update (use double buffering)
- bug fix: OZ1DLD/P would not turn green
- better visualazation of AS column
